This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch in Python. The Perceptron, a fundamental building block of neural networks, is implemented using NumPy for matrix operations. The project is designed to mimic the structure of popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, making it easy to integrate and understand.
Features:

    Custom Perceptron class for binary classification tasks
    Implementation of the perceptron learning rule with adjustable learning rate and epochs
    Separate training (train.py) and execution (main.py) files for modularity and ease of use
    Follows a structure similar to scikit-learn for intuitive use

Installation:

Simply clone the repository and run the main.py file to see the Perceptron in action!

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptron-from-scratch.git
cd perceptron-from-scratch
python main.py

Usage:

    Modify the input data in main.py to fit your classification task.
    Customize learning rate, epoch count, and input size through the Perceptron class.
